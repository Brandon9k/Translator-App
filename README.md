# Translator-App

Submitted by: Brandon Christian

TranslateMe is a simple translator app that currently only takes English words or sentences and can convert them to French. The app is able to store the most recent translations for the user to review or just have a quick look over and when they want to clear the history they can delete it with a button at the bottom. If the user closes or dismisses the app its instance will persist meaning the stored translations will be available when the app is restarted. 

Time spent: 14 hours spent in total

## Required Features
- [X] Users open the app to a TranslationMe home page with a place to enter a word, phrase or sentence, a button to translate, and another field that should initially be empty
- [X] When users tap translate, the word written in the upper field translates in the lower field. The requirement is only that you can translate from one language to another.
- [X] A history of translations can be stored (in a scroll view in the same screen, or a new screen)
- [X] The history of translations can be erased
 
## Optional implemented:

- [ ] Add a variety of choices for the languages
- [ ] Add UI flair
